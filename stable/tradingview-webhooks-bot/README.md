## Customized TradingView Webhooks Bot for Educational Materials

This repository is a customized version of [robswc/tradingview-webhooks-bot](https://github.com/robswc/tradingview-webhooks-bot), forked to meet specific requirements for educational materials.


## TVWB 

Tradingview-webhooks-bot (TVWB) is a small, Python-based framework that allows you to extend or implement your own logic
using data from [Tradingview's webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/). TVWB is not a trading library, it's a framework for building your own trading logic.

 
The original TVWB can be found on GitHub at [robswc/tradingview-webhooks-bot](https://github.com/robswc/tradingview-webhooks-bot): a framework for trading with tradingview webhooks!

## What is this repository?

This web application is based on TVWB, but has been customized to meet specific needs. 

### Redis Pub/Sub or Redis streams
It registers a single event and action, and then receives pre-defined TradingView messages, pushing them into Redis Pub/Sub or Redis streams. The application serves as a Redis Publisher or Redis Stream Adder.

TradingView messages are demultiplexed by the web application according to clientID (IBKR clientID), and are directed to different Redis channels or streams.


### A custom PineScript library
TradingView's webhooks are generated by a custom PineScript library, [PineTradingbotWebhook](https://www.tradingview.com/script/xOO4qW1P-PineTradingbotWebhook/)

### Reading Order Tracking from Database

This web application can read TradingView webhook alerts or IBKR contracts (orders) from an SQL database, and display them on web pages. However, the SQL database is created by a separate application, TBOT, which is not part of this repository.
